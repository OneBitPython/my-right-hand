# MyRightHand

 This is a virtual assistant called MyRightHand. It has been made by team PHP_sucks. It is intended to be a bot that helps you in coding, by giving you a table of contents, which you can use to study study basic concepts.and it also answers a few basic coding questions, mainly related to AI and ML. But creating a bot only for answering coding problems would have been pretty boring, because of that we have added many other features, a few you can read about in the next section. Oh, and also this bot jelps in python coding questions specifically.

 It has a settings page which you can use to customize different things like your name and the voice of the assistant (Male and Female). It also calculates where your internet is coming from.

 There are also options like telling jokes, showing satellite maps and road maps and even showing fun facts and quotes. It can also carry out basic mathematical calculations and basic conversions.
